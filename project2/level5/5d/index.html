	<p class="one">soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,</p>
	<p class="one">Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year!
	<p class="one">My hasting days fly on with full career,
	<p class="one">But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.
	<p class="two">Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,
	<p class="two">That I to manhood am arrived so near,
	<p class="two">And inward ripeness doth much less appear,
	<p class="two">That some more timely-happy spirits indu'th.
	<p class="three">Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,
	<p class="three">It shall be still in strictest measure even
	<p class="three">To that same lot, however mean or high,
	<p class="four">Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven,
	<p class="four">All is, if I have grace to use it so,
	<p class="four">As ever in my great Task-master's eye</p>

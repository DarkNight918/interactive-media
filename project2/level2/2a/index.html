<h1>HOW</h1> 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsoon hath Time, the <h6>subtle</h6>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthief of youth,
Stolen on his wing my <em>three and twentieth</em> year!</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy hasting days fly on with full career,</p>
<h6>But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th.</h6>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPerhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,</h4>
<h3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat I to <em>manhood</em> am arrived so near,</h3>
<h6>And inward ripeness doth much less appear,</h6>
<h3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat some more timely-happy spirits indu’th.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt shall be still in strictest measure even To that same lot, however mean or high, Toward which Time leads me,</p>
<h2>and the will of <strong>Heaven,</strong></h2>
<h6>All is, if I have grace to use it so,</h6>
<h4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs ever in my great Task-master’s eye</h4>

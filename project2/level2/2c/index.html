	<h1>HOW soon hath Time,</h1>
	<li><h3>the subtle thief of youth,</h3></li>
</ul>
<h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStolen on his wing my three and twentieth year!</h1>

	<h1>My hasting days fly on with full career,</h1>
	<li><h3>But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th.</h3></li>

	<h2>Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,</h2>
	<li><h4>That I to manhood am arrived so near,</h4></li>
	<li><h4>And inward ripeness doth much less appear,</h4></li>
	<li><h4>That some more timely-happy spirits indu’th.</h4></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<h1>Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,</h1>
	<li><h3>It shall be still in strictest measure even</h3></li>
	<li><h3>To that same lot, however mean or high,</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven,</h3></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<h1>All is, if I have grace to use it so,</h1>
	<li><h5>As ever in my great Task-master’s eye</h5></li>

<p>HOW</p>

<div class="content">
<p>soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,</p>
<p>Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year!</p>
<p>My hasting days fly on with full career,</p>
<p>But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.</p>
<p>Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,</p>
<p>That I to manhood am arrived so near,</p>
<p>And inward ripeness doth much less appear,</p>
<p>That some more timely-happy spirits indu'th.</p>
<p>Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,</p>
<p>It shall be still in strictest measure even</p>
<p>To that same lot, however mean or high,</p>
<p>Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven,</p>
<p>All is, if I have grace to use it so,</p>
<p>As ever in my great Task-master's eye</p>

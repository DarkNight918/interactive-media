Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year!
My hasting days fly on with full career,
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.

That I to manhood am arrived so near,

It shall be still in strictest measure even
To that same lot, however mean or high,

All is, if I have grace to use it so,
As ever in my great Task-master's eye</p>

<div class="content">
<h2>soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,<br><br><br><br>
Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year!<br><br><br><br>
My hasting days fly on with full career,<br><br><br><br>
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.<br><br><br><br>
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,<br><br><br><br>
That I to manhood am arrived so near,<br><br><br><br>
And inward ripeness doth much less appear,<br><br><br><br>
That some more timely-happy spirits indu'th.<br><br><br><br>
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,<br><br><br><br>
It shall be still in strictest measure even<br><br><br><br>
To that same lot, however mean or high,<br><br><br><br>
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven,<br><br><br><br>
All is, if I have grace to use it so,<br><br><br><br>
As ever in my great Task-master's eye<br><br><br><br></h2>

	<h1>How to Survive an Encounter with an Ostrich</h1>
		<h2> Method 1: Evading a Charging Ostrich</h2>
			<ol>

				<li><strong>Run for nearby cover.</strong> Expect ostriches to attain speeds of 43 mph (70 km) over open ground. If there is dense vegetation or woods close enough for you to reach before the ostrich reaches you, sprint for that. Prevent the ostrich from attaining optimum speed so it has less chance of outrunning you.
					<ul>
						<li>If there is more sturdy cover than vegetation (such as a car or manmade structure), go for that. A kick from an ostrich’s leg can hit you with an impact of 500 psi, which is enough to kill a human.</li>
						<li>If you don’t think you can make it, DO NOT attempt it. Ostriches are extremely fast and will attack by kicking you in the back as soon as they catch up to you.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><strong>Conceal yourself.</strong> Rest assured that, while ostriches do eat meat, they stick to insects, small reptiles, and rodents. Understand that a provoked ostrich will chase humans primarily because it feels threatened, not because it wants to eat them. At your first opportunity, duck behind cover that conceals you from its view, rather than risk a prolonged chase. Expect the ostrich to lose interest once it thinks that you are gone.
				</li>

				<li><strong>Elevate youreself.</strong> Remember that an ostrich is incapable of flight. If no hiding places are to be found on ground-level, climb a tree, fence, or other structure. Wait for the ostrich to lose interest and leave before coming back down.
					<ul>
						<li>An adult ostrich typically stands 7 to 9 feet tall (2 to 3 meters). Although it has no teeth, it may jab at you with its beak and potentially upset your balance. Seek a higher elevation to keep out of range.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

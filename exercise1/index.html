	<h1>How to Survive an Encounter with an Ostrich</h1>
		<h2> Method 1: Evading a Charging Ostrich</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Run for nearby cover.</strong> Expect ostriches to attain speeds of 43 mph (70 km) over open ground. If there is dense vegetation or woods close enough for you to reach before the ostrich reaches you, sprint for that. Prevent the ostrich from attaining optimum speed so it has less chance of outrunning you.
					<ul>
						<li>If there is more sturdy cover than vegetation (such as a car or manmade structure), go for that. A kick from an ostrich’s leg can hit you with an impact of 500 psi, which is enough to kill a human.</li>
						<li>If you don’t think you can make it, DO NOT attempt it. Ostriches are extremely fast and will attack by kicking you in the back as soon as they catch up to you.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
